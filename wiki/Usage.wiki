= Defining Interfaces =
Lets pickup an example of a _Calculator_ service. <br />

The contract will be defined as 
{{{

public interface Calculator {

   double add(double x, double y);

   double multiply(double x, double y);

}

}}}

The implementation will be 
{{{
public class CalculatorImpl implements Calculator {
   
   public double add(double x, double y) {
      return x + y;
   }

   public double multiply(double x, double y) {
      return x * y;
   }
}
}}}
